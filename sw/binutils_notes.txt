//Need to work on `bfd/elf32-volt32.c`.  The relocate section stuff is where
//I left off.

Remember `enable_binutils_autotools.sh` and `autoreconf`

The TL;DR is Add a config.sub target, ../configure --target <my-fun-target> and make until it fails.

That's fine. The advice of just adding a `config.sub` and 
`../configure --target <my-fun-target>` is probably all I need. (edited)
